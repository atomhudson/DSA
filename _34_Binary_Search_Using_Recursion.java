//   Recurrence Relation
//   [ F(N) = O(1) + F( N / 2); ]
//   What out Recurrence relation saying?
// ->Means for the (N) size array,
//      we are making a comparison in constant time and
//      searching the target in the array size (N / 2);
//   O(1): Comparison that we gonna make.
//   F(N/2): Dividing into 2 half.


//   Types of Recurrence Relation.
//    1. Linear Recurrence Relation: Fibonacci Number
//         |
//          -> This is not getting factored , this is getting subtracted and added linearly.
//    2. Divide and Conquer Recurrence Relation : Binary Search
//         |
//          -> Reduced by a factor
